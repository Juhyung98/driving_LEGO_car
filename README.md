It is a project linked with smart_project.      
It contains code that controls the motors of a LEGO's model car and a code that measures the distance with an ultrasonic sensor.  
It controls the motor through Bluetooth communication with the lego car.     
If you run main in the _legocar directory, the car keeps a constant speed and goes straight.     
While going straight ahead, using an ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance ahead.     
If it is recognized that there is an obstacle in front of the 30cm radius, the vehicle stops by controlling the speed.     
If you use the internal code, you can also adjust the forward, backward and direction with specific keys on the keyboard.
