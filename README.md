It contains code that controls the motors of LEGO's model cars.    
If you run main in the _legor directory, the car keeps a constant speed and goes straight.     
While going straight ahead, using an ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance ahead.     
If it is recognized that there is an obstacle in front of the 30cm radius, the vehicle stops by controlling the speed.     
If you use the internal code, you can also adjust the forward, backward and direction with specific keys on the keyboard.
